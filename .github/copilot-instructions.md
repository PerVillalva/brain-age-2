# React TypeScript Reaction Time Test Project

This is a React.js TypeScript implementation of a reaction time test based on the jsPsych tutorial. The project implements a cognitive assessment tool where users respond to colored circles (blue/orange) with specific keyboard inputs (F/J keys).

## Project Structure

-   React 18+ with TypeScript
-   Vite for build tooling and development server
-   Component-based architecture for experiment phases
-   Real-time data collection and analysis

## Development Guidelines

-   Use functional components with React hooks
-   Implement TypeScript interfaces for data structures
-   Follow React best practices for state management
-   Ensure accessible keyboard navigation

## Key Features

-   Welcome screen and instruction display
-   Fixation cross with randomized timing
-   Blue/orange circle stimuli presentation
-   Keyboard response collection (F/J keys)
-   Real-time accuracy and response time calculation
-   Results summary with performance metrics

## Testing Requirements

-   Responsive design for various screen sizes
-   Cross-browser compatibility
-   Accurate timing measurements
-   Data validation and error handling
